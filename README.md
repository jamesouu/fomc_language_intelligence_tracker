## 🔥 What This Project Does

- **Reads and analyzes** official FOMC statements (2020–2025)
- **Applies an AI LLM** (OpenAI's GPT-4o) to **score hawkishness/dovishness** per meeting
- **Extracts key macro topics** (growth, inflation, labor market, financial stability)
- **Aligns scores** with real **Fed Funds Rate movements**  
- **Visualizes policy cycles** and **annotates pivotal shifts** ("First Cut", "Pivot Signal", etc.)

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- **Macro regime changes** often **start with language shifts** before markets move.
- **Tracking FOMC tone + real rates** helps predict policy pivots earlier.
- **LLMs unlock insights** at scale – enhancing discretionary macro investing.
