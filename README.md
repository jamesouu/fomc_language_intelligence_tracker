# fomc_language_intelligence_tracker
AI-powered FOMC decision tracker built for macro hedge fund research. Combines LLM analysis with rates data to generate real-time policy tone intelligence.

---
🔥 What This Project Does
	•	Reads and analyzes official FOMC statements (2020–2025)
	•	Applies an AI LLM (OpenAI’s GPT-4o) to score hawkishness/dovishness per meeting
	•	Extracts key macro topics (growth, inflation, labor market, financial stability)
	•	Aligns scores with real Fed Funds Rate movements
	•	Visualizes policy cycles and annotates pivotal shifts (“First Cut”, “Pivot Signal”, etc.)

⸻

🎯 Why It Matters
	•	Macro regime changes often start with language shifts before markets move.
	•	Tracking FOMC tone + real rates helps predict policy pivots earlier.
	•	LLMs unlock insights at scale – enhancing discretionary macro investing.
